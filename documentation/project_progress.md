# GEM Data Hackathon: Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on the Butler Institute GEM Data Hackathon 2025. The challenge is to analyze the diverse characteristics of American entrepreneurs using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) dataset from 2015-2021.

### Challenge Statement
> "Offer a comprehensive analysis of the diverse characteristics of American entrepreneurs, including aspects such as their backgrounds, co-founder dynamics, industry preferences, impact on employment, market selection strategies, ambitions, and factors influencing their decision to discontinue their ventures. Utilize all available variables from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) dataset and feel free to enhance your analysis by integrating it with additional relevant datasets."

## Analysis Plan
We created a comprehensive analysis approach document (`documentation/analysis_approach.md`) that outlines our strategy for addressing each component of the challenge. The plan includes:

1. **Entrepreneur Backgrounds & Demographic Analysis**
2. **Co-founder Dynamics & Team Composition Analysis**
3. **Business Discontinuation Factors Analysis**
4. **Market Selection Strategies & Growth Analysis**
5. **Industry Preferences & Employment Impact Analysis**
6. **Entrepreneur Ambitions Analysis**
7. **Supplemental Datasets Integration**
8. **Advanced Analytics Opportunities**
9. **Policy Implications Analysis**

## Current Progress

### Completed Work

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Initial R data processing script (`documentation/initial_r_data_import_work.md`)
   - Data dictionary creation (`documentation/updated_data_dictionary.md`)
   - Initial exploratory notebooks (`notebooks/data_import.ipynb`, `notebooks/gem_data_exploration.ipynb`, `notebooks/gem_weighted_analysis.ipynb`)

2. **Analysis Implementation**
   - Created `notebooks/entrepreneur_profiles.ipynb` to analyze entrepreneur backgrounds, demographics, and identify distinct entrepreneur personas through clustering
   - Developed `notebooks/cofounder_dynamics.ipynb` to examine team composition patterns and relationships between team size and business outcomes
   - Built `notebooks/business_discontinuation.ipynb` with predictive modeling to identify factors leading to business discontinuation

### Key Findings So Far

Our preliminary analyses have yielded several insights (to be updated after notebook execution):

1. **Entrepreneur Profiles**
   - Identified demographic patterns in entrepreneurship rates across gender, age, race, education, and region
   - Applied clustering to identify distinct entrepreneur personas
   - Analyzed factors that predict entrepreneurial activity

2. **Co-founder Dynamics**
   - Examined team size distributions across new and established entrepreneurs
   - Analyzed how team composition varies by industry
   - Identified relationships between team size and business performance metrics

3. **Business Discontinuation**
   - Analyzed demographic and temporal patterns in business discontinuation
   - Identified industry sectors with highest/lowest discontinuation rates
   - Built predictive models to identify key risk factors for business failure

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Analysis Areas**
   - Market selection strategies analysis
   - Industry preferences and employment impact analysis
   - Entrepreneur ambitions analysis

2. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Integrate results from all analysis areas
   - Identify cross-cutting themes and insights
   - Prepare final conclusions and recommendations

3. **Create Deliverables**
   - Prepare 3 slides for final submission:
     - Slide 1-2: Key results and visualizations
     - Slide 3: Methodology explanation

## Timeline
- **March 7-8, 2025**: Complete remaining analyses
- **March 8-9, 2025**: Synthesize findings and create final slides
- **March 9, 2025, 9 PM ET**: Submit deliverable to butlerinstitute@babson.edu
