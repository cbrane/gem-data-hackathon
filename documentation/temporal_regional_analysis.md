# Temporal and Regional Entrepreneurship Analysis Documentation

## Overview

This document provides guidance for completing the "Temporal and Regional Entrepreneurship Analysis" notebook, which focuses on analyzing entrepreneurial activity across time (2015-2021) and regions in the United States. The analysis compares new and established entrepreneurs across different industries, with a special emphasis on pre and post-COVID patterns.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Temporal Patterns**: How has entrepreneurial activity (both new and established) changed over time (2015-2021)?
2. **Regional Variations**: What regional patterns exist in entrepreneurship rates across the United States?
3. **Industry Preferences by Region**: How do industry preferences differ across regions?
4. **COVID-19 Impact**: What impact did COVID-19 have on entrepreneurial activity across industries and regions?
5. **Business Sustainability**: What is the relationship between new and established entrepreneurship by region and industry?

## Data Needed

The analysis will use the GEM dataset with the following key variables:

- `year`: Survey year (2015-2021)
- `region`: US region based on FEMA regions
- `new_entrepreneur`: Involvement in early-stage entrepreneurial activity
- `established_entrepreneur`: Owner-manager of established business (older than 3.5 years)
- `new_entrepreneur_industry`: Industry of early-stage business
- `established_entrepreneur_industry`: Industry of established business
- `weight`: Observation weight for statistical analysis

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Time Trend Analysis

- Calculate yearly entrepreneurship rates for both new and established entrepreneurs
- Track changes in entrepreneurship rates over the 2015-2021 period
- Identify patterns before and after major events (particularly COVID-19)
- Create line charts showing the evolution of entrepreneurship rates over time

### 2. Regional Analysis

- Calculate regional entrepreneurship rates for both new and established entrepreneurs
- Compare entrepreneurship rates across the 10 US regions
- Identify high and low entrepreneurship regions
- Create bar charts comparing regions by entrepreneurship rates

### 3. Combined Time and Regional Analysis

- Create heatmaps showing entrepreneurship rates by region and year
- Identify regions that have seen the most significant changes over time
- Track regional patterns before and after COVID-19
- Identify regions that have been most/least resilient during economic shifts

### 4. Industry Analysis by Year and Region

- Calculate industry distribution over time for both new and established entrepreneurs
- Track changes in industry preferences over the 2015-2021 period
- Identify regional industry specialization patterns
- Create visualizations showing industry evolution over time and across regions

### 5. COVID-19 Impact Analysis

- Compare industry distributions before and after COVID-19
- Calculate percentage changes in industry representation
- Identify industries that grew or declined during the pandemic
- Create visualizations highlighting industries most impacted by COVID-19

### 6. New vs. Established Business Analysis

- Compare patterns between new and established entrepreneurs by region and industry
- Calculate "survival ratios" (established to new entrepreneur ratios) by industry
- Identify industries with high and low business sustainability
- Create visualizations comparing new and established business patterns

## Expected Outputs

1. **Time Series Charts**: Line charts showing entrepreneurship trends over time
2. **Regional Comparison Charts**: Bar charts and maps showing regional patterns
3. **Industry Evolution Visualizations**: Charts showing changes in industry representation over time
4. **COVID-19 Impact Visualizations**: Pre/post COVID comparisons for industries and regions
5. **New vs. Established Business Comparisons**: Visualizations of business sustainability by industry and region
6. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Written insights and conclusions based on the data

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use weighted calculations with the `weight` variable for all percentage calculations
- Handle missing values appropriately for industry variables
- Use consistent color schemes for visualizations (viridis palette for new entrepreneurs, plasma for established)
- Include annotations on charts (value labels, COVID-19 marker line, etc.)
- Create regional heatmaps to visualize spatial patterns
- Use proper statistical approaches for comparing distributions

## Integration with Other Analyses

This analysis complements the existing notebooks in the following ways:

1. **Entrepreneur Profiles Notebook**: The regional patterns identified can be integrated with demographic profiles to understand regional entrepreneurial ecosystems.

2. **Industry Preferences Notebook**: The temporal industry trends can provide context for the broader industry preference analysis.

3. **Business Discontinuation Notebook**: The survival ratios calculated can be compared with discontinuation factors to understand business sustainability.

4. **Co-founder Dynamics Notebook**: Regional patterns in entrepreneurship can be cross-referenced with team composition patterns.

## Next Steps After Completion

After completing this analysis:

1. Integrate key findings with other notebook analyses
2. Develop policy recommendations based on regional patterns
3. Consider additional visualizations (maps, dashboards) for the final presentation
4. Identify opportunities for further research or data collection

## Resources Needed

- Complete GEM dataset (2015-2021)
- Knowledge of pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Background information on US regions and economic patterns
- Understanding of COVID-19 timeline and impacts

## Timeline

1. Data preparation and initial exploratory analysis
2. Time trend analysis
3. Regional analysis
4. Industry analysis by time and region
5. COVID-19 impact analysis
6. New vs. established business comparison
7. Integration of findings and conclusions
