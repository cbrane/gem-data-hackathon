# GEM Data Hackathon: Analysis Approach

## Hackathon Challenge

> "Offer a comprehensive analysis of the diverse characteristics of American entrepreneurs, including aspects such as their backgrounds, co-founder dynamics, industry preferences, impact on employment, market selection strategies, ambitions, and factors influencing their decision to discontinue their ventures. Utilize all available variables from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) dataset and feel free to enhance your analysis by integrating it with additional relevant datasets."

This document outlines our comprehensive approach to addressing each component of the challenge statement. We've structured our analysis plan to directly address all seven key aspects mentioned in the challenge: (1) backgrounds, (2) co-founder dynamics, (3) industry preferences, (4) impact on employment, (5) market selection strategies, (6) ambitions, and (7) factors influencing business discontinuation.

## 1. Entrepreneur Backgrounds & Demographic Analysis

This section directly addresses the "backgrounds" component of the challenge.

### Objectives
- Create comprehensive entrepreneur personas based on demographic patterns
- Analyze intersectionality of demographic factors (gender, race, age, education, income)
- Compare profiles between new and established entrepreneurs
- Identify key background factors that predict entrepreneurial activity

### Methods
1. **Clustering Analysis**
   - Apply k-means clustering on demographic variables (age, gender, education, income, region)
   - Identify 3-5 distinct entrepreneur personas
   - Compare cluster characteristics between new and established entrepreneurs

2. **Intersectionality Analysis**
   - Create cross-tabulations of entrepreneurship rates by multiple demographic factors
   - Calculate weighted percentages for combinations (e.g., Black women aged 25-34)
   - Identify underrepresented and overrepresented groups

3. **Entrepreneurial Journey Visualization**
   - Track progression from aspiring entrepreneur to established business owner
   - Create Sankey diagrams showing transitions between entrepreneurial stages
   - Identify demographic patterns in entrepreneurial progression

### Code Structure
```python
# Clustering approach
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Select relevant demographic variables
profile_vars = ['age_range', 'gender', 'race', 'education', 'household_income', 'region']
entrepreneurs = gem_data[gem_data['new_entrepreneur'] == 'Yes']

# Prepare data (encode categorical variables, scale)
X_encoded = pd.get_dummies(entrepreneurs[profile_vars])
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_encoded)

# Apply clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
entrepreneurs['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
